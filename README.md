## Coral-Reef-Bleaching-in-the-State-of-Florida-during-COVID-19

This project evaluated whether the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown had an immediate impact on the health of coral reefs in the Florida Keys. Coral reefs are sensitive ecosystems, and prior research suggested that reduced human activity during lockdowns elsewhere had positive ecological effects. This study specifically analyzed sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration, salinity, sea surface density, and wind speed between January 2018 and June 2021 to detect any significant short-term changes. Data were obtained from Copernicus Marine Service datasets and processed using Python libraries like Xarray, Cartopy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. After extensive visualization, statistical correlation analysis, and anomaly detection, the findings showed no major immediate improvement in coral health during the lockdown period. However, evidence suggested that after 2020, rising sea surface temperatures and associated environmental changes began to place increased stress on coral reefs.
